- Resume text classification
- Interactive web app with Streamlit
- Trained on real resume data

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Python
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression

## üìä Dataset

Public Kaggle dataset: [Resume Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/resume-dataset)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the App

```sh
git clone git@github.com:YourName/automated-resume-screener.git
cd automated-resume-screener
conda create -n resume-nlp python=3.10
conda activate resume-nlp
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app/app.py
```

## üèãÔ∏è Model Training & Evaluation

After running `train_model.py`, the model is trained on the cleaned and deduplicated resume dataset. During training, the following steps and results are observed:

- **Duplicates removed:** 796 duplicate resumes were found and removed for better generalization.
- **Class imbalance warning:** Some classes have fewer than 5 samples (e.g., Operations Manager, Web Designing, PMO). This can make predictions for these classes less reliable.

- **Classification report:**  
  The model's performance on the test set is summarized below:

    ```

- **Cross-validated accuracy:**  
  `0.8316 ¬± 0.0553` (mean ¬± std), indicating the model performs reasonably well overall, but performance may vary across classes.

- **Sanity check (shuffled labels):**  
  Accuracy drops to `0.0419` when labels are shuffled, confirming the model is learning meaningful patterns and there is no data leakage.

### üìâ Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix visualizes the model's predictions versus the true categories on the test set. This helps identify which classes are most often confused with each other.

![Confusion Matrix](figure/training_log.png)

**How to interpret:**  
- Each row represents the true class, and each column represents the predicted class.
- Diagonal values (top-left to bottom-right) show correct predictions.
- Off-diagonal values indicate misclassifications.
- Sparse or empty rows/columns for some classes (especially those with few samples) indicate the model struggles to predict or encounter those classes.

**Note:**  
Classes with very few samples (less than 5) may have unreliable metrics and may not be well represented in the confusion matrix.
